What comes from it? According to them, we’re just objects among other objects in space, all equally dead. It does not matter are you a conscious being or not. Life has no value. Everything is being run a by fate probably for the lulz. Human is reduced just to a tool. Happiness and suffering has no meaning. But even this means God was here, created the reality and left. I don't think this is the case.<br><br>About perception:<br>With analysis objects register in perceptions differently. Size, shape, texture, color and even price matter. Few smaller objects nearby (like few small candles) itself will register differently than a single large object in the corner of ma room (a chair). Sometimes there is not enough time for proper analysis, that will cause an instinctical reaction to avoid it. Some object register with a surprise because of their non-typical shape, color and position in space. Such I call ninja objects. If we walk to a room, look around, all objects get to perception and mind builds a map of it with categorization of objects. All of those objects build &quot;the place&quot;. Animated objects have their own category (like humans, animals, robots etc). Every object has it's own proprieties so it can be unique in the memory (a person, their desk, their cat, a weapon, the room itself), so, after a while, we can know what to expect, that is, what will be happening (as our simulation in imagination tells us) so we can use our logic and perhaps make a plan. If the plan wont fire up we can tell something went wrong. Then we analyze the plan again. The quicker we do it the better it is for us. Afterwards we can memorize objects for longer and keep it in knowledge and remove them and what happened to them from short memory to keep our sanity and mind in shape (too many objects and events in short memory wont make a good working perception due to brain limitations). Different groups of people have different perception mechanisms in disposal. The reason we get lost in a forest is all places look alike and have basically same proprieties, so we can't find The Way and find out what to do. Animals and humans have different sets of object proprieties and methods of analysis. Lets emulate perception ^^ Now, where does the idea come from? :O So i think idea is the best option from all the simulations of certain focus we had, subconsciously. Most expanssive groups are most successfull.</p></div></article></main><footer class="mt-20 px-10 py-8 bg-slate-200"><div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto text-slate-700 text-center">© 2020 <a href="/" class="font-medium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vredeburg</a>.
