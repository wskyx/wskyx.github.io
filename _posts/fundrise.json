  "html": "<p>So, the situaion is: five weeks ago I had a mental breakdown and I went to a psychiatric hospital. I'm fine now but they keep me in the hospital because it was one breakdown too many. Now mym mom and the docs are giving up on me and they want to put me into a care home. I'm 37. A court will decide whether to place me in a care home or not. This is where I need a lawyer which costs $600. I do not want to go to a care home, it is crossing my plans like doing my art exhibition or going abroad. Plus in such placews there is limited freedom, privacy, there is potential thievery, violence, alcohol and drugs. It is no good.\n<br>\n<br>\nSo i need your help to rise funds fot that lawyer, if you finf this cause right please donate via PayPal, the donate button is in the bottom of the page.\n<br>\n<br>\nThank you\n<br>\n<br>\nCurrently there is $170/600 rised.\n<br>\nThis data is being updated manually.</p>\n",
