  "html": "<p>So, the situaion is: five weeks ago I had a mental breakdown and I went to a psychiatric hospital. I'm fine now but they keep me in the hospital because it was one breakdown too many. Now my mom and the docs are giving up on me and they want to put me into a care home. I'm 37. A court will decide whether to place me in a care home or not. This is where I need a lawyer which costs $650. I do not want to go to a care home, it is crossing my plans like doing my art exhibition or going abroad. Plus in such places there is limited freedom, privacy, there is potential thievery, violence, alcohol and drugs. It is no good. I expect a letter from the court in around two-three weeks from now, then I have to hire the lawyer as soon as possible.\n<br>\n<br>\nSo I need your help to raise funds fot that lawyer, if you want to help please donate via PayPal, the donate button is in the bottom of the page.\n<br>\n<br>\nThank you\n<br>\n<br>\nCurrently there is $620/$650 raised.\n<br>\nThis data is being updated manually.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Update 04/19/2024 Friday</b>\n<br>\nThere still was no expert witness psychiarist eximining me nor the letter from the court. I keep on waiting.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Update 04/23/2024 Tuesday</b>\n<br>\nI got a letter from the courrt saying that they're redirecting the process to my home city where I live (the hospital I'm in is placed in another city)\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Update 05/18/2024 Saturday</b>\n<br>\nI got information from the court saying that the expert whitness will be assigned to me after 05/29/2024</p>\n",
