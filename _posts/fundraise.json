  "html": "<p>So, the situaion is: five weeks ago I had a mental breakdown and I went to a psychiatric hospital. I'm fine now but they keep me in the hospital because it was one breakdown too many. Now my mom and the docs are giving up on me and they want to put me into a care home. I'm 37. A court will decide whether to place me in a care home or not. This is where I need a lawyer which costs $650. I do not want to go to a care home, it is crossing my plans like doing my art exhibition or going abroad. Plus in such places there is limited freedom, privacy, there is potential thievery, violence, alcohol and drugs. It is no good.\n<br>\n<br>\nSo I need your help to raise funds fot that lawyer, if you want to help please donate via PayPal, the donate button is in the bottom of the page.\n<br>\n<br>\nThank you\n<br>\n<br>\nCurrently there is $335/$650 raised.\n<br>\nThis data is being updated manually.</p>\n",
